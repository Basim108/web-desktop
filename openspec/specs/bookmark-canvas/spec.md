# bookmark-canvas Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change bookmark-desktop-new-tab. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Bookmark Desktop Canvas Display
The system SHALL display, on the new-tab page canvas, only the direct bookmark children of the currently selected folder, rendered as icons, and SHALL navigate the current tab to a bookmark's URL when its icon is clicked, provided the URL's scheme is on an explicit safe allowlist (e.g. `http:`, `https:`, `file:`). The system SHALL NOT navigate when the bookmark's URL scheme is not on that allowlist.

#### Scenario: Selecting a folder shows only its direct bookmarks
- **WHEN** a folder is selected
- **THEN** the canvas displays icons for that folder's direct bookmark children only, excluding subfolders and nested folders' bookmarks

#### Scenario: Clicking a bookmark navigates
- **WHEN** the user clicks a bookmark icon whose URL scheme is on the safe allowlist
- **THEN** the current tab navigates to that bookmark's URL

#### Scenario: Clicking a bookmark with a dangerous URL scheme does not navigate
- **WHEN** the user clicks a bookmark icon whose URL scheme is not on the safe allowlist (e.g. `javascript:`, `data:`, `chrome:`)
- **THEN** the current tab does not navigate

### Requirement: Grid Pagination
The system SHALL paginate a folder's bookmarks into pages when the bookmark count exceeds one page's grid capacity, navigable as a carousel.

#### Scenario: Folder exceeds one page's capacity
- **WHEN** a folder's bookmark count exceeds the current grid's rows × cols capacity
- **THEN** the canvas splits the bookmarks across multiple navigable pages

### Requirement: Responsive Grid Sizing
The system SHALL size grid cells (and thereby bookmark icons) using a fixed, unconfigurable 3-tier step function of the canvas's own available width, and SHALL derive grid capacity (columns and rows) by dividing available width and height by the resulting tier size and rounding down, with no further stretching of icon size to fill leftover space. Each tier of this step function SHALL also fix a corresponding bookmark-label font-size, resolved together with the tier's icon size so the two can never independently disagree for the same available width.

#### Scenario: Smallest tier below 512px
- **WHEN** the canvas's available width is below 512px
- **THEN** grid cells and bookmark icons render at 80px, and bookmark labels render at 0.75rem

#### Scenario: Middle tier from 512px up to 1024px
- **WHEN** the canvas's available width is at least 512px and below 1024px
- **THEN** grid cells and bookmark icons render at 106px, and bookmark labels render at 0.85rem

#### Scenario: Largest tier at 1024px and wider
- **WHEN** the canvas's available width is at least 1024px
- **THEN** grid cells and bookmark icons render at 166px, and bookmark labels render at 1rem

#### Scenario: Capacity derived by floor division
- **WHEN** the grid's current tier icon size and the canvas's available width and height are known
- **THEN** the number of columns is the available width divided by the tier icon size rounded down, and the number of rows is the available height divided by the tier icon size rounded down

#### Scenario: Leftover space is not used to stretch icons
- **WHEN** the available width or height does not divide evenly by the tier icon size
- **THEN** the remaining space is left unused rather than growing icon size beyond the tier value

### Requirement: Canvas Hides Native Scroll Controls
The system SHALL hide the canvas's native horizontal and vertical scrollbar controls while keeping the canvas scrollable by other input methods (e.g. wheel, trackpad, keyboard).

#### Scenario: No visible scrollbar when content briefly exceeds the container
- **WHEN** the canvas grid's rendered content exceeds the container's visible area
- **THEN** no native vertical or horizontal scrollbar track or thumb is rendered, but the content can still be scrolled with the wheel or trackpad

### Requirement: Cell Hover Affordance
The system SHALL highlight a grid cell's entire area, including any space not occupied by its icon or label, when the mouse hovers over a cell that contains a bookmark, and SHALL show a pointer cursor while hovering such a cell at rest. The system SHALL NOT apply any hover highlight or cursor change to a grid cell that contains no bookmark.

#### Scenario: Hovering an occupied cell highlights the whole cell
- **WHEN** the mouse moves over a grid cell that contains a bookmark
- **THEN** the entire cell area is highlighted, including any space around the icon and label not filled by their own content

#### Scenario: Pointer cursor while hovering an occupied cell
- **WHEN** the mouse is over a grid cell that contains a bookmark and no drag is in progress
- **THEN** the cursor is a pointer

#### Scenario: Grabbing cursor while a bookmark is being dragged
- **WHEN** the user is actively dragging a bookmark icon
- **THEN** the cursor is a grabbing cursor rather than a pointer

#### Scenario: Empty cells show no hover feedback
- **WHEN** the mouse moves over a grid cell that contains no bookmark and no drag is in progress
- **THEN** the cell is not highlighted and the cursor remains the default arrow

### Requirement: Column Growth Backfill
When auto-mode column count increases, the system SHALL backfill the newly created cells by pulling subsequent items forward from later pages, cascading across pages as needed, which may reduce the number of pages.

#### Scenario: Adding columns pulls items from the next page
- **WHEN** the grid gains columns and a later page has items
- **THEN** those newly created cells are filled with items pulled forward from the next page(s), cascading until pages are refilled or exhausted

### Requirement: Row Growth Leaves Empty Cells
When auto-mode row count increases, the system SHALL NOT backfill the newly created cells; they SHALL remain empty.

#### Scenario: Adding rows creates empty cells
- **WHEN** the grid gains rows
- **THEN** the newly created cells remain empty; no items are pulled forward to fill them

### Requirement: Grid Shrink Compaction and Cascade
When column or row count decreases and existing items are displaced, the system SHALL first compact displaced items into any empty cells already present on the same page, and only push remaining overflow to the next page (cascading across subsequent pages) once the page has no empty cells left.

#### Scenario: Displaced items compact into empty cells on the same page
- **WHEN** the grid loses columns or rows and a page has empty cells available
- **THEN** displaced items are moved into those empty cells before anything is pushed to another page

#### Scenario: Displaced items overflow to next page when page is full
- **WHEN** a page has no empty cells left to absorb displaced items
- **THEN** the remaining displaced items are pushed to the next page, cascading further if that page is also full

### Requirement: Position Persistence
The system SHALL store each bookmark's grid position (page, row, col) per folder, and SHALL reproduce that exact layout across new-tab page loads and browser restarts.

#### Scenario: Layout survives reopening a new tab
- **WHEN** the user closes and reopens a new tab
- **THEN** every bookmark icon in the previously viewed folder appears in its previously stored position

### Requirement: Next-Free-Cell Placement
The system SHALL place a bookmark into the next free grid cell of its folder whenever it newly appears there — on first run (using Chrome's bookmark order only to determine the one-time seeding sequence), when freshly created, or when moved in from another folder (including a folder it previously occupied) — without regard to any previously stored position or Chrome's current order among existing siblings.

#### Scenario: First-run seeding uses Chrome order
- **WHEN** the extension runs for the first time and a folder has no stored positions
- **THEN** its bookmarks are assigned to cells in sequence following Chrome's bookmark order

#### Scenario: New bookmark placed in next free cell
- **WHEN** a bookmark is newly created in a folder
- **THEN** it is placed in the next free grid cell of that folder

#### Scenario: Bookmark moved into a folder placed in next free cell
- **WHEN** a bookmark is moved into a folder from another folder, including a folder it previously occupied
- **THEN** any previous stored position is discarded and it is placed in the next free grid cell of the destination folder

### Requirement: Chrome-Native Reorder Ignored
The system SHALL ignore bookmark reordering performed within Chrome's own bookmark manager (within the same parent folder) and SHALL NOT recompute stored positions in response.

#### Scenario: Reordering in Chrome's bookmark manager has no effect on canvas layout
- **WHEN** the user reorders bookmarks within the same folder using Chrome's native bookmark manager
- **THEN** the stored canvas positions of those bookmarks remain unchanged

### Requirement: Manual Drag Repositioning
The system SHALL update a bookmark's stored position immediately when the user drags its icon to a new cell within the canvas, and SHALL swap the positions of two icons when one is dropped onto a cell already occupied by another.

#### Scenario: Dragging to an empty cell sets position
- **WHEN** the user drags a bookmark icon to an empty cell
- **THEN** that bookmark's stored position is updated to the target cell

#### Scenario: Dropping onto an occupied cell swaps positions
- **WHEN** the user drags a bookmark icon and drops it onto a cell occupied by another bookmark icon
- **THEN** the two bookmarks' stored positions are swapped

### Requirement: Pinned Position Resilience Under Shrink
When a bookmark's stored cell no longer fits within the current grid due to shrinking, the system SHALL push it to an overflow page and SHALL restore it to its exact stored position once the grid regains sufficient capacity, without ever discarding or recomputing that stored position due to a temporary size constraint.

#### Scenario: Item pushed to overflow page when grid shrinks
- **WHEN** the grid shrinks below the capacity needed to display a bookmark's stored cell
- **THEN** that bookmark is pushed to an overflow page rather than having its stored position changed

#### Scenario: Item resumes original position when grid regains capacity
- **WHEN** the grid regains enough capacity to include a previously overflowed bookmark's stored cell
- **THEN** that bookmark reappears in its exact original stored position

### Requirement: Drag-to-Edge Pagination
The system SHALL auto-advance to the adjacent page when the user drags an icon to the edge of the canvas while a drag is in progress.

#### Scenario: Dragging to canvas edge advances page
- **WHEN** the user drags a bookmark icon to the edge of the canvas and holds it there
- **THEN** the canvas advances to the next or previous page as appropriate

### Requirement: Per-Bookmark Label Display
The system SHALL allow each bookmark to independently configure whether its name is shown under its icon or only as a tooltip, defaulting to shown-under-icon, with no inheritance from its containing folder. This setting SHALL be presented inside the Edit Bookmark window as a single checkbox: checked means the name is shown under the icon, and unchecked means the name is shown only as a tooltip that appears on hover.

#### Scenario: Default label display
- **WHEN** a bookmark has no explicit label-display setting
- **THEN** its name is shown under its icon

#### Scenario: Per-bookmark override does not affect siblings
- **WHEN** the user sets one bookmark's label display to tooltip-only
- **THEN** other bookmarks in the same folder retain their own independent label-display settings

#### Scenario: Label visibility toggled via the window checkbox
- **WHEN** the user unchecks the "show label under icon" checkbox in the Edit Bookmark window and saves
- **THEN** that bookmark's name is no longer shown under its icon and instead appears only as a tooltip on hover

### Requirement: Live Cross-Tab Layout Sync
The system SHALL propagate layout changes (position updates, grid-setting changes) live to all currently open new-tab pages within the same browser profile.

#### Scenario: Drag in one tab reflects in another open tab
- **WHEN** the user drags an icon to a new position in one open new-tab page
- **THEN** all other currently open new-tab pages update to reflect the new position without requiring a manual reload

### Requirement: Canvas Data Cleanup on Removal
The system SHALL remove a bookmark's or folder's stored settings when it is removed via `chrome.bookmarks`, so that no orphaned per-item canvas data persists after removal.

#### Scenario: Removing a bookmark cleans up its settings
- **WHEN** a bookmark is removed via `chrome.bookmarks`
- **THEN** its stored bookmark settings (e.g. label-display override) are deleted

#### Scenario: Removing a folder cleans up its settings
- **WHEN** a folder is removed via `chrome.bookmarks`
- **THEN** its stored folder settings are deleted
