 * Single source of truth for the extension-state export/import file-format

 *
 * - `x` (major) changes only on a BREAKING format change — an importer of one
 *   major cannot process a file of a different major.
 * - `y` (minor) changes when the format gains a backward-compatible feature.
 * - `z` (patch) changes on a bug fix with no compatibility effect.
 *
 * IMPORTANT (project rule): any change that raises the MAJOR here must be
 * surfaced to the user during the proposal phase — a breaking format bump is
 * never allowed to pass unnoticed, since files of a mismatched major are denied
 * on import and existing backups would be stranded.
